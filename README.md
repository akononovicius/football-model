# Analysis and modeling of football data set

This repository contains scripts developed in GNU Octave (scripts should be
compatible with Matlab) for the purpose of analyzing empirical football data
set. All analysis and modeling is split into two obvious parts: analysis and
modeling (two separate folders in this repository). Analysis part is further
subdivided into two parts: cleaning and analysis (two separate scripts).

Note that along with the scripts we make available cleaned up data in Matlab's
workspace file (\*.mat) format. Raw data was obtained from
[this repository on GitHub](https://github.com/jalapic/engsoccerdata).

Note that the modeling ideas strongly overlaps with ideas discussed by prof.
Tony Padilla in
[this Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv9wpQIGZDw).
